class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        occur = {}
        for num in nums:
            if num in occur:
                occur[num] = occur[num] + 1
            else:
                occur[num] = 1
                
        occured = sorted(occur, key=lambda x: occur[x], reverse=True)
        return occured[:k]

We almost got through this without help. The for/if functions came naturally with a little bit of context. We even sorted to return but a test case with -numbers made it fail. The solution wasn't natural but the lambda function does make sense.
